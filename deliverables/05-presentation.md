# Capstone Presentation

It's the last assignment! You'll have 5-10 minutes to present your Capstone project.

## Structure

Here's a general guideline for the structure of your presentation.

1. Introduction / Elevator Pitch
2. Overview of core features and concepts
3. Overview of architecture & technical solutions
4. Potential stretch goals
5. Questions from the audience

## Tips

- Have a strong introduction.
- Speak with cleared, measured delivery.
- Smooth handoffs / segues / signoffs.
- Avoid discussing trivial UI steps such as logging in.
- Focus on interactions that are a critical part of the app's identity.
- Cite interesting facts not evident from the visuals.
- Focus more on solutions you developed, less on APIs you leveraged.
- Avoid cluttering slides with too much detail.
- BIG FONT SIZE!
- End on an invitation to check out your repo / app.

## Tell a narrative

Frame your app with a specific story, as if documenting a real user's moment-by-moment
use. A good story gives the audience a direct template to imagine themselves in.

### Example 1

#### Worst

> Hangout is an app for people to connect with their friends. The permissions structure
> allows people to invite other people to those events.

#### Better

> College students use Hangout to plan social events. Hangout can be used to plan
> everything from private parties to campus-wide ragers.

#### Best

> It's three weeks until Collin's big Halloween party. He wants everyone on campus to show
> up. Collin makes a party invite on Hangout. Finn just got his invite to the big party.
> Because Collin set the permissions to "Public", Finn is inviting guests that Collin
> isn't connected with - exactly what Collin wanted.

### Example 2

#### Worst

> Pothole Patrol is an app that cities use to manage their pothole problems. Road workers
> and city administrators work together to track the work being done.

#### Better

> Collin fixes potholes for the city of Chicago. As he does his work, he takes pictures
> and reports his work to city administrators with Pothole Patrol. Then, he'll receive his
> next assignment through the app.

#### Best

> Collin works on a road crew fixing potholes in the city of Chicago. He's out working on
> a pothole at the corner of Chicago and Franklin. Once he's done filling in, he uploads a
> picture of it to Pothole Patrol. His manager Finn receives the picture right away and
> schedules Collin's next pothole down the road at Chicago and Wells.
