# Project Pitch

On Canvas, submit a document that includes:

- 30 second elevator pitch for your project
- Concrete core features that will be implemented in the MVP
- Stretch goal features
- Your project management system
  - high-level tickets on what needs to be done
  - how tickets will be assigned

The document should also include the following technical details.

- detailed database schema with all tables, properties, and relations defined
- list of API endpoints and how they interact with the tables
- detailed [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) of your frontend
  - all pages, forms, routes, etc
- a [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) for each MVP feature

You will be using this document to pitch your capstone to your instructor. In that
meeting, the instructor will approve your pitch or give you feedback on what needs to be
fixed. **Do not start the project until your pitch has been approved.**

Be ambitious, but also be prepared to scope down! There (almost certainly) will not be
enough time to develop everything perfectly, but you can and are encouraged to continue
working on this project after you graduate!
