# Capstone Defense

It's not enough to just build a project, you also have to talk about it in an interview!

You will participate in a formal "tell me about your project" interview with your
instructor. The interview will start with a question about one of your app's core
features, and then branch off into follow-up questions about your project architecture.

## Goals

- Effectively communicate architectural decisions
- Discuss the trade-offs that come with using specific technologies
- Walk through the vertical slice of a request-response cycle from frontend to backend

## Topics

Here are some key topics and concepts to study and brush up on. You should be able to
discuss _what_ you used and _why_.
