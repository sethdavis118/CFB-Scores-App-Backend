# Code Review

Aim to have at least one core featured implemented and pushed to GitHub. Instructors will
give written feedback on your code, so make sure your main branch is clean and
presentable!

## Code Guidelines

Here are some useful tips and suggestions for proofreading and editing your code.

### Functionality

- Make sure the core feature is (mostly) working. Don't worry about edge cases.
- The code in the main branch works on multiple machines.

### Code Style

- Delete unused variables, imports, logs, etc.
- Delete reference code, such as TODO comments or template files.
- _Consistently_ format each file.
- Follow consistent naming conventions, such as:
  - `PascalCase` for React components and files
  - `camelCase` for variables and function names
  - nouns for variable names
  - verbs for function names
- Spell check your files and fix any typos.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for your variables and functions.
- Avoid abbreviations and prefer explicitly spelling words out.
- Abstract shared logic into separate functions and files instead of repeating code.

### Documentation

- Comments should be at a higher level than the code itself. Avoid repeating code.
- Prefer code that is self-documenting over comments (e.g. descriptive variable names).
- If you got code from an outside source, credit the source in a comment.
- Document all components and functions - 1-2 sentence descriptions are plenty.
- Write a thorough README file that includes information such as
  - overview with a description, problem statement, goals, screenshots, etc
  - core distinguishing features of the project
  - tech stack: technologies, tools, and frameworks used
  - architecture overview: folder structure, system design, etc
