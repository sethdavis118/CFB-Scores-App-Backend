# Review Site

## Overview

This is a review site where users can review things, like a movie they just watched, the
car they're leasing, or the responsiveness of their landlord.

## Core Features

- Guests can browse a list of user-submitted posts
- Guests can view details for a specific post and see its average rating
- Users with an account can CRUD reviews that include
  - a written text comment
  - a numerical score / rating

## Stretch Goals

- Allow visitors to search or filter reviews by name, category, etc
- Add images to reviews
- Claim ownership of a reviewed item
  - e.g. "I own this restaurant" or "I wrote this book"
  - respond to reviews on that item as the owner
