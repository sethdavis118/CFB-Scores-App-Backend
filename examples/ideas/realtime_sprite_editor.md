# Realtime Sprite Editor

## Overview

This is application for creating animated sprites. Users can collaborate with their
friends in real time.

## Core Features

- Create a sequence of frames, where each frame is a grid of colored cells
- Play the sprite at a given playback speed
- Invite other users by sending a unique URL for the sprite
- Anyone invited can edit the sprite in real time

## Stretch Goals

- Save the sprite so users can continue a sprite later
- Create multiple layers (e.g. background, foreground, character)
- Export the sprite as either a GIF or spritesheet
- Set a sprite to "private" so only invited registered users can edit the sprite
