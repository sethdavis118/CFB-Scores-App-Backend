# Capstone

Congratulations! You've made it to the Capstone project!

## Goals

The purpose of the Capstone is to:

- have a _polished_ project that you can show off and talk about with employers
- review and synthesize all the material you've learned so far
- work with a team on a professional project

This is _not_ the time to:

- launch a startup and make money
- learn shallowly in a different language and ecosystem
- learn a complex new library

## Objectives

At a high level, a capstone project requires demonstration of the following abilities.

### Project Management

- Use Git to version control code
- Collaborate with other developers on GitHub

### Frontend

- Design React components based on project specs
- Provide an interface for users to send CRUD requests to an API
- Dynamically render components based on data from an API
- Display different views to authenticated users
- Create an accessible and aesthetically pleasing user experience

### Backend

- Design a database schema of coherent relational models based on project specs
- Query a relational database for requested data
- Securely handle user account information
- Design a RESTful API with documented endpoints
- Architect Express middleware and routers
- Serve data from a seeded database

## Deliverables

You will need to submit the following deliverables as you work on the capstone project.
Refer to [the schedule](/schedule.md) to know when each deliverable is due.

1. [Project Pitch](deliverables/01-pitch.md)
2. [Code Review](deliverables/02-code_review.md)
3. [Deployment](deliverables/03-deployment.md)

In addition, your instructor will be running stand-up meetings with you each class,
where you will be expected to share what you've accomplished, what you're currently
working on, and what blockers are impeding your progress, if any.
